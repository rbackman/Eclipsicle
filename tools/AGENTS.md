# Agent Instructions for `tools`

Helper simulators and utilities for testing run on the host.

- Build the C++ programs with `make` to produce binaries like `simulate_bricks` and `simulate_strip`.
- The `arduino_stub/` directory supplies a minimal Arduino API for these host builds.
- Source files should compile as C++17.
